## Be aware that this uses the gym_super_mario_bros module :/
The tutorial I followed uses the data.json file that's complementary to the game, and the one we are using in Master and Q-learn does not have the x-axis position in it 

## Install
- python setup.py
- Try if it worked by running:
    - python -m retro.examples.interactive --game SuperMarioBros3-Nes

## Navigation
### Interactive Mode 
In the interactive mode, the user can navigate Mario through the levels.
- Use arrows left/right to move left/right
- Use keys Y/Z (depending on keyboard layout) to jump
