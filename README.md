## Install
- python setup.py
- Try if it worked by running:
    - `python -m retro.examples.interactive --game SuperMarioBros3-Nes`

## How to use it
I had to run the following command once after opening a new terminal: 
1. `python -m retro.import ROMs`

Afterwards I was able to run `python random_agent.py`

## Navigation
### Interactive Mode 
In the interactive mode, the user can navigate Mario through the levels.
- Use arrows left/right to move left/right
- Use keys Y/Z (depending on keyboard layout) to jump
